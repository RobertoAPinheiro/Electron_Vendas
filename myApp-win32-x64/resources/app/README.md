# Electron_Vendas
This code is a simple example of an Electron application, which simulates a Sales System for a store.
This was based on a tutorial by Leonardo Hip√≥lito, available on YouTube.
It has parts in Portuguese and parts in English, because it is only a test made to know and learn the tool (Electron).
